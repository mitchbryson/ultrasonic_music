# Workshop on building an Arduino-based custom electronic instrument

Resources for a Arduino-based workshop on building a custom musical instrument using an ultrasonic range sensor and potentiometer.

Click on the file "ultra_music.ino" above to access the code for the device.

The pdf worksheets describe the steps in building the circuit and programming the device.

The device connects to the web to play musical tones, based on readings from the potentiometer and ultrasonic range finder: connect to the device using this site:
